## Exercise I

a)
 o(n^3)

b)
 0(n^2)

c)
o(n)

## Exercise II
 the best way, i would go about this is to use a binary search method
 n = number of floors, 
 since n is the number of floors, i would divide n // 2 and  throw an egg from the floor, if the egg breaks, i'll decrement the number 
 else if it doesnt break I'll increment the number by 1, and compare the numbers
